				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					Imagine you're rushing to grab a few last-minute items at CVS, eager to check out quickly using
					self-checkout—only to be met with error messages, confusing instructions, and a line forming behind you. This
					case study examines real user experiences with CVS's self-checkout system, identifying key usability pain
					points and exploring how interface design impacts everyday shoppers.

				<h2>Part 1: Sketch & Interface Description</h2>

				<h3>Description of the Interface</h3>
				<p>
					The CVS self-checkout machine is designed to provide customers with a quick and independent way to purchase
					things without needing a cashier. Key components include a touchscreen interface for selecting options, a
					barcode scanner for scanning products, a card payment console, a cash input/output section, and a bagging area
					with a weight sensor. The interface aims to streamline the checkout process by reducing wait times and
					offering an alternative for users who prefer self-service.

				<h2>Part 2: Observations & Interviews</h2>

				<h3>Observations</h3>
				<p>Below are some key observations from watching customers interact with the CVS self-checkout machine:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The "bagging area" was often unclear to users, as bags were located opposite to where they were supposed to
						place their items. This resulted in slower checkout times, as the machine doesn't allow the next item to be
						scanned until it registers the previous item.
					</li>
					<li>Many users struggled with scanning irregularly shaped items, requiring multiple attempts.</li>
					<li>
						Payment processing caused delays, and users were often unsure when to begin using the seperate payment
						device.
					</li>
					<li>
						Users also had trouble with inserting coupons into the designated slot, where they would often get lodged.
					</li>
					<li>At least one user required employee assistance due to an error message that they could not resolve.</li>
					<li>Experienced users completed the checkout process significantly faster than first-time users.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Interview Questions</h3>
				<p>
					The following questions were used to gather user insights regarding their experience with the self-checkout
					machine:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Before today, how often have you used a self-checkout machine at CVS or elsewhere?</li>
					<li>What was the first thing you noticed when you approached the self-checkout machine?</li>
					<li>Can you describe your overall experience using the CVS self-checkout today?</li>
					<li>What, if anything, surprised you about the process?</li>
					<li>Were there any points in the process where you hesitated or felt unsure about what to do next?</li>
					<li>What aspects of the self-checkout process felt easiest to you?</li>
					<li>If you could change one thing about the self-checkout experience, what would it be?</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Summary of Responses</h3>
				<p>Below are key insights from user interviews:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Most users expected a smooth and fast experience but were slowed down by minor technical issues.</li>
					<li>Some users found the scanning process inconsistent and were frustrated by bagging area delays.</li>
					<li>One user mentioned frustration over the coupon insertion slot.</li>
					<li>Another user found the card payment process unintuitive, especially with tap-to-pay options.</li>
					<li>
						Most users said they would use self-checkout again, but some said they would opt for a cashier if they had
						multiple coupons or items prone to scanning issues.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Part 3: Personas</h2>

				<h3>Persona 1: Rushed Rachel</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/Rushed Rachel Empathy Map.png" alt="Empathy Map for Routine Shopper" />
				</figure>
				<p>
					<strong>Description:</strong> Rachel is a busy mother of two with a full-time job who uses self-checkout to
					save time but often feels frustrated by delays in the process.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Interface Challenges:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bagging area sensitivity: The system flags errors when she moves items too quickly.</li>
					<li>Unclear coupon scanning process: She isn't sure when or where to scan coupons.</li>
					<li>Error handling delays: Attendant assistance is required too frequently, slowing her down.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Why Rachel Represents Users:</strong> She's a common type of user at self-checkouts — busy, impatient,
					and task-focused. Many customers, particularly working parents or commuters, rely on self-checkout to speed up
					shopping but become frustrated when the system introduces unexpected delays.
				</p>

				<h3>Persona 2: Cautious Carl</h3>
				<figure>
					<img src="assets/Cautious Carl Empathy Map.png" alt="Empathy Map for First-Time User" />
					<figcaption>Empathy map for a first-time self-checkout user.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					<strong>Description:</strong> Carl is a 55-year-old retiree who is new to self-checkout and prefers
					traditional cashier interactions. He is careful and methodical but finds the interface confusing and
					intimidating.
				</p>
				<p><strong>Interface Challenges:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Overwhelming number of options on the screen makes it hard to focus on key tasks.</li>
					<li>Unclear guidance on scanning and payment steps leads to hesitation.</li>
					<li>Too many system alerts (e.g., “Please remove item”) cause confusion and uncertainty.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Why Carl Represents Users:</strong> He represents those who are hesitant or unfamiliar with
					self-checkout technology. Many older customers or those who don't use technology often face similar
					challenges. They need clearer step-by-step guidance and reassurance that they're doing things correctly.

					This storyboard follows Rushed Rachel, who wants to quickly purchase groceries before heading home to make
					dinner, but scanning issues, coupon confusion, and bagging system errors create frustration.

				<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
				<p>
					Through this project, I gained valuable insights into real-world user challenges at self-checkout kiosks. My
					research highlighted common frustrations like unclear coupon scanning and bagging area errors. Creating
					personas and a storyboard helped visualize user struggles, emphasizing the importance of intuitive design in
					self-service interfaces.
